        <h2>1 Introduction: The Scientific Imperative for Europa Exploration</h2>
        <p> Jupiter’s moon Europa may have conditions suitable for life as we know it. Evidence from magnetic induction and geology points to the existence of a global subsurface ocean today (McKinnon et al. 2009), and it is plausible that Europa’s ocean could contain the appropriate chemical building blocks and have chemical sources of energy to support life (Vance et al. 2023, this collection). Europa is an ice-enshrouded world with interrelated geophysical processes spanning its deep interior, ocean and ice shell, surface, tenuous atmosphere, and surrounding space environment. For these reasons, the first two planetary science decadal surveys (National Research Council 2003, 2011) ranked Europa exploration as a top scientific priority. Ultimately, in 2015, NASA formally initiated the Europa Clipper project.</p>

        <h2>The Galileo Mission</h2>
        <p>While the Voyager data began to define Europa as a geologic world, the Galileo spacecraft hinted at Europa as a potentially habitable world. Galileo entered Jupiter orbit in December 1995 and ended its mission by impacting Jupiter in September 2003, typically making a flyby of one of the Galilean satellites with each orbit. Perhaps its greatest discovery was the near-certain existence of a subsurface ocean below an ice shell today (Pappalardo et al. 1999; McKinnon et al. 2009). Magnetometer measurements implied an induced magnetic moment of 120 nT around the moon, indicative of an electrically conducting layer that is most likely salty, liquid water (Kivelson et al. 2000). The interpretation of data from the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) suggested surface compounds related to freezing of liquid water leading to formation of hydrated salts (McCord et al. 1998; Carlson et al. 2009). Galileo gravity data and an inferred moment of inertia suggested an outer H2O-layer (ocean plus ice shell) thickness of 105–160 km</p>

        <h2>Mission Mangal</h2>
        <p>On November 5, 2013, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched its first spacecraft bound for Mars. India built Mangalyaan (“Mars craft” in English) to study the Red Planet and test key technologies required for exploring the inner solar system. The Mangalyaan spacecraft successfully entered Mars orbit on September 23, 2014, making ISRO only the fourth space agency in the world to do so. Prior to India, only the United States, the Soviet Union and the European Space Agency (ESA) had successfully explored Mars.</p>
