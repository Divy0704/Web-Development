    <p>The Europa mission is a space project focused on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Scientists believe there might be an ocean of liquid water under its icy surface, which could potentially support life.
        <ul>
         <p><b>Here's a simple breakdown of the mission:</b></p>
        
        <li><b>Goal:</b> The main aim is to <b>"study Europa's ice shell and the ocean beneath"</b> it to see if it can support life.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li><b>Spacecraft:</b> A spacecraft will be sent to Europa. It will carry special instruments to analyze<b> "the moon's surface"</b> and gather data about its ocean.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li> <b>Key Questions:</b> Scientists want to know about <b>"the moon's chemistry, ice thickness, and whether"</b> there are signs of life.</li> 
        <br>
        
        <li><b>Importance:</b> Discovering life or the conditions for life on Europa would help us understand more about <b>"the potential for life"</b> elsewhere in the universe.</li> 
        <br>
        
        <li> <b>Timeline:</b> The mission is planned to <b>"launch in the near future, with a journey to Europa"</b> that will take several years.</li> 
        <br>
        
         <b>Overall</b>, the Europa mission is an exciting step in exploring the possibility of life beyond Earth!
